### Project Overview: Todo List Web Application

This project is a **Todo List** web application designed to help users easily manage their tasks. The application provides a simple, intuitive interface where users can add tasks, track progress, categorize tasks, and filter by different criteria.

#### Key Features:

1. **Task Management**:
   - Users can add new tasks by entering a description and selecting a category (Work, Personal, Shopping, Health, or None).
   - The task input form includes a text field for the task description and a dropdown menu for category selection.

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - A progress bar and completion count help users track their task completion. The app displays the number of tasks completed out of the total number of tasks, providing a clear visual indication of progress.

3. **Task Filters**:
   - **Status Filters**: The app includes filters to display tasks based on their completion status:
     - **All**: Displays all tasks.
     - **Active**: Displays tasks that are yet to be completed.
     - **Completed**: Displays tasks that have been marked as done.
   - **Category Filters**: Users can filter tasks by category to view tasks specific to areas such as Work, Personal, Shopping, or Health.

4. **Interactive UI**:
   - The app uses buttons and icons to provide an interactive experience. Filters are easily accessible for switching between different task views.
   - The user interface is clean and responsive, ensuring that the app looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.

5. **Empty State Handling**:
   - If no tasks are present, an informative message ("No tasks found. Add some tasks to get started!") is displayed, encouraging users to add their first task.

#### Structure:
- **Header**: Displays the application title "Todo List" with an icon.
- **Todo Form**: Allows users to input new tasks and categorize them.
- **Progress Section**: Shows the completion status of tasks through a progress bar and a count of completed vs. total tasks.
- **Filters**: Provides buttons for filtering tasks by their status (All, Active, Completed) and by category (Work, Personal, Shopping, Health).
- **Task List**: Displays the list of tasks, which is dynamically updated as tasks are added or marked as completed.
- **Empty State**: Displays a message when there are no tasks in the list.

This Todo List web application provides an effective way to manage tasks with user-friendly functionality and an organized layout. It is a practical tool for anyone looking to stay on top of their tasks, whether for personal or professional purposes.
